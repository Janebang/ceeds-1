### What did you do this week?

- Julia : This week I worked through parts of the Data Camp course “Building Web Applications in R with Shiny.”  I also did some reading about the Shiny (http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html) and how it works. 

- Marta: This week I also started working on the Data Camp course on building web apps with Shiny. We also met up with Paul on Friday and we learned more about what his purposes and intended audience were in building the Macleish weather station site.

    - Before meeting with our client, we used the website our client wants us to work on to understand out client more before meeting him. 
    After coming up with questions as a team, we emailed our client as soon as possible. Fortunatley, he was available to meet this week.
    Thus, we were able to meet discuss the project with him and learn more about what need to prioritize for our project. After discussing
    as a group, we decided to learn Shiny through Data Camp for this project. I've started the course and I am currently in the process of
    completing the Shiny Introduction course. 

### What is it that you're struggling with right now?

- Julia: I have a questions about Shiny and how we can use it in our project.
- Marta: I'm still learning about Shiny and how we can apply it to our project.
- Mirella
    - As a team, trying to access the 10 minute data report. Trying to figure out the cleaest way to access it and a let it be availbale for the
    public. 

### What are you planning to do next week?

- Julia: I'm planning on reading more of the weather report that Paul sent us to get a better feel for the data. I'm also planning on trying to experiment with shiny in r with sample data sets to see how it works better.  
    
- Marta: I'm planning on finishing up the Data Camp course and possibly doing another if I feel like that'll help me understand it more.
- Mirella
    - Finish the Shiny DataCamp Introduction Course, and meet Paul again.
