### What did you do this week?

- Julia : This week I worked through parts of the Data Camp course “Building Web Applications in R with Shiny.”  I also did some reading about the Shiny (http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html) and how it works. 

- Marta: This week I also started working on the Data Camp course on building web apps with Shiny. We also met up with Paul on Friday and we learned more about what his purposes and intended audience were in building the Macleish weather station site.

### What are you planning to do next week?

- Julia: I'm planning on reading more of the weather report that Paul sent us to get a better feel for the data. I'm also planning on trying to experiment with shiny in r with sample data sets to see how it works better.  
    
- Marta: I'm planning on finishing up the Data Camp course and possibly doing another if I feel like that'll help me understand it more.
